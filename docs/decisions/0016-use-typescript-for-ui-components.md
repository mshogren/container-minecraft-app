# Use TypeScript for UI components

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to pick a programming language and associated tools to use to build our API
* that provides us with an opportunity to learn a new ecosystem
* allows us to implement the technical requirements of the project
* allows us to be productive

Which one should we choose?

## Considered Options

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
* [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "TypeScript", because 
* JavaScript and TypeScript have an extensive ecosystem and community.
* We are already very familiar with JavaScript so Typescript
  * provides us with an opportunity to learn a new ecosystem.
  * allows us to be productive with a shorter learning curve.
* Typescript is a more marketable skill than Elm or ClojureScript at this time.
